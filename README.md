# Real Life Mod

The Real Life Mod is a mod that makes the base game more realistic by integrating real-world principles, processes, and mechanics. This mod introduces a level of complexity and realisticness.

For example, basic items like science packs requires flasks and beakers. To advance through the tech tree, you’re gonna need to apply real-world chemistry and formulas, ensuring that you dont mess up that much.

As you dive deeper into the mod, you’re gonna encounter even more advanced challenges, such as needing to set up detailed chemical reactors for creating synthetic materials or implementing real-life power generation methods like wind turbines or dams. The mod also introduces realistic manufacturing constraints, such as the need for specific tools and machinery, and requires careful management of resources to avoid environmental impacts, mirroring the sustainability concerns faced in real-world industries.

The goal of the Real Life Mod is to mimic real-life scenarios and decision-making processes as closely as possible, offering players a unique and challenging experience that goes beyond the standard gameplay. This mod is perfect for those who enjoy deep strategy, complex problem-solving, realism, and learning about the intricate connections between science, engineering, and technology in a highly detailed virtual environment like in real life.
